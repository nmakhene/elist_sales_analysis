## Summary of Insights
### Yearly Sales Summary
#### Analysis:
  To summarize yearly insights for 2019-2022, I created a PivotTable (table below) that detailed number of order, total sales, and average order value by year. One eye-catching insight is the 163% increase in sales from 2019 to 2020. The average order value (AOV) also increased by 31%. Many industries saw increases in sales due to the shutdown during the pandemic, so it's very likely that those boost in sales are due to that. 
  Sales and order count are about the same for 2020 and 2021. In 2022, total sales and average order value return almost to their pre-COVID levels in 2022. However, order count is quite a bit higher than it was pre-COVID. This could be an opportunity to focus on increasing AOV and capitalizing on the increase in order, thereby increasing sales without having to acquire new customers.

#### Key Points:
- 2020 is the best sales year to date, which is likely due to COVID-19/pandemic sales trends across many industries
- By 2022, total sales and average order value have returned to their pre-COVID numbers
- 2019 had the lowest numberes across all 3 sales KPI's. When comparing 2019 and 2022 excluding COVID sales, there was a 28% increase in sales

### Monthly Sales Summary
#### Analysis:
Similarly to yearly insights, I created a PivotTable with number of orders, total sales, and average order value. One insight that coincides with a boost in sales due to COVID is the 50% increase in sales and 46% increase in order count for March 2020. Monthly trends emerged looking over the span of 4 years of sales numbers. Across all years, sales KPI's tend to be the highest in November and December. There is usually a decrease in numbers in January and February. October across all years sees a drop in sales and September (with the exception of 2022) always see an increase in sales. It's possible that people spend more during the holiday season, therefore spending less in January and February to balance out their spending. The beginning of the school year could explain the increase in sales in September and it's possible that October is a lower sales month due to people saving from "back to school" shopping as well as holding out for the holiday season. I recommend creating an incentive for people to either shop more in October without disincentivizing them to withhold in November (Black Friday). Potentially, we could encourage clients to shop more in October so that they'll recieve a coupon in November that would stack on Black Friday deals the company is already offering. 

#### Key Points:
- March 2020 had the highest increase in sales and order count MoM
- October 2022 had the biggest decrease in sales MoM. October 2022 also had the lowest sales KPI's from 2019-2022
- Highest sales months tend to be in November, December, and September
